FontParts
=========

An API for interacting with the parts of fonts during the font
development process. FontParts is a candidate to replace
`RoboFab <http://robofab.com>`__. The documentation is at
`fontparts.readthedocs.io <http://fontparts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

*This is a work in progress. We are still working out the API, abstract
implementation, example implementation, test suite and documentation.*
